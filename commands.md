<details>
<summary>Schedule Commands</summary>

All require the **organizer role**. The bot tracks one schedule message per server — a single living post that is edited in place.

**Message format:** events are sorted by start time. Past events show as ~~strikethrough~~, planned placeholders show as *italics*, start.gg-linked events are hyperlinked.

**Title persistence:** the title is stored as the first line of the message (`# Title`) and extracted automatically on each sync — it does not need to be re-supplied.

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/schedule-post` | Post a new tracked schedule message in a channel |
| `/schedule-update` | Refresh the tracked message, optionally changing the title |
| `/schedule-plan-event` | Add a planned event placeholder to the schedule |
| `/schedule-plan-remove` | Remove a planned event placeholder |

**Planned events:** use `/schedule-plan-event` to add a placeholder for an event before it exists as a real Discord event. When you later run `/event-create` with the same name (case-insensitive), the placeholder is automatically removed and the schedule is refreshed.

<summary>League Commands</summary>
